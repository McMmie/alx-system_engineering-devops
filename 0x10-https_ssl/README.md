## What is HTTPS SSL?

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are protocols designed to secure the communication between a user's web browser and a website's server.

### SSL's Two Main Roles:

1. **Authentication:** SSL provides a mechanism for authenticating the identity of the server to the client and, optionally, the client to the server. This helps users ensure they are connecting to the legitimate website and not a malicious actor impersonating the site.

2. **Encryption:** SSL encrypts the data exchanged between the user's browser and the server, ensuring that sensitive information such as login credentials, personal details, and financial transactions remain confidential and secure during transit.

## Purpose of Encrypting Traffic:

The primary purpose of encrypting traffic, achieved through SSL, is to enhance the security and privacy of data transmitted over the internet. Encryption scrambles the information in such a way that only authorized parties (the sender and the intended recipient) can understand it, protecting it from eavesdroppers and potential attackers. This is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information exchanged online.

## SSL Termination:

SSL termination refers to the process of decrypting encrypted traffic at a certain point in the network, typically at a load balancer or a proxy server, before forwarding it to the destination server. This allows the server to process the unencrypted data internally. SSL termination is commonly used for improving server performance, as the decryption process can be resource-intensive. It also enables the inspection of the unencrypted traffic for security purposes before reaching the backend servers.

**Note:** While SSL termination involves decrypting the traffic at an intermediate point, it's essential to ensure that the subsequent communication between the intermediate point and the backend servers remains secure.
