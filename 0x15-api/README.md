<h1>API</h1>

Introduction
Welcome to the documentation for our API (Application Programming Interface). This API allows developers to interact with our system and retrieve or manipulate data programmatically. This document will guide you through the process of using our API, including authentication, endpoints, request methods, and response formats.

Examples
1. Authentication
To access our API, you need to authenticate your requests. We use API keys for authentication. Please contact our support team to obtain your API key. Include your API key in the request headers using the following format:

plaintext
Copy code
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
2. RESTful API Basics
Our API follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST). REST is an architectural style that uses a stateless communication model and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform actions on resources.

3. Endpoints
Our API provides various endpoints to interact with different resources. Each endpoint corresponds to a specific functionality. Refer to the API documentation for a list of available endpoints and their descriptions.

Example Endpoint: /users

4. Request Methods
The following HTTP methods are used in our API:

GET: Retrieve data from the server.
POST: Create a new resource on the server.
PUT: Update an existing resource on the server.
DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.
5. Response Formats
Responses from the API are typically in JSON format. Successful responses will include relevant data, while error responses will contain error messages.

Example Successful Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "user_id": 123,
    "username": "example_user"
  }
}
Example Error Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Invalid API key"
}
6. Error Handling
Error responses will include an appropriate HTTP status code along with a JSON object containing error details. Refer to the API documentation for a list of possible error codes and their meanings.

7. Rate Limiting
To ensure fair usage and prevent abuse, our API has rate limiting in place. Check the headers of each response for information on your current rate limit status.
