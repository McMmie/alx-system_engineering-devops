Nginx  is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache. The software was created by Russian developer Igor Sysoev and publicly released in 2004.[9] Nginx is free and open-source software, released under the terms of the 2-clause BSD license. A large fraction of web servers use Nginx,[10] often as a load balancer.[11](wikipedia)
